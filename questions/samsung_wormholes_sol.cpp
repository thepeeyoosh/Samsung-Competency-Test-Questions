//			Samsung Wormholes spaceship Problem and Solution			===
//=================================================================================================
//Question::
// There is a source (S) and destination (D) and a spacecraft has to go from S to D. There are N number of wormholes in between
// which has following properties:
//  Each wormhole has an entry and an exit.
//  Each wormhole is bi-directional i.e. one can enter and exit from any of the ends.
// The time to cross the wormhole is given and the spacecraft may or may not use the wormhole to reach D.
// The time taken to travel outside wormhole between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given  
// by a formula |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| where, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of two points.
// The coordinates of S and D are given and we have to find the minimum time to reach D from S.
// Note: Itâ€™s not mandatory to consider all the wormholes
// Example : 
//source=(0,0), destination(100,100), wormholes=3
// coordinates are:          
// (1,2),(120,120) Cost = 5
// (4,5),(120,100) Cost = 21
// (6,8),(150,180) Cost = 23
//
// Sample output=48
//
// Explanation:
// Cost from (0,0) to (1,2) is 3
// Cost of wormhole 1 is 5
// Cost from (120,120) to (100,100) is 40
// So, total 48
